        PATCh Tool Apps

        The PATCh tool is a set of open source data analysis and visualisation apps made by analysts from various authorities nationally
        with Python teaching and development from from Data to Insight and development from Social Finance. The apps run entirely in the 
        browser, without sending data to any servers. This means that it's safe to use data in any app as it does not leave your computer.

        For those interested in how the PATCh tool works: every time you load a PATCh app, the webpage will use something called Pyodide to run
        Python in the browser. The product of the Python code is then displayed as HTML using a package called streamlit lite.
        This only outside connection the apps make is the initial setup to run Python in the browser. Once an app is running it's self contained,
        you could even test this by running apps with the internet turned off once they've loaded. Pyodide uses your browser's memory 
        and other resources to run the Python code making up the apps on your computer. This is unlike many other apps which would run the Python 
        on a server somewhere and send information back and forth, which is why you can't use confidential data with them. The way streamlit 
        lite works is that every time you do something in the app, it re-runs the Python code from the beginning (not including the install). 
        This allows it to be easier to write for analysts, but does mean some apps take a while to update between widget interractions.

        Data to Insight is a national project led by local authorities with
        support from the ADCS, DLUHC, DfE and Ofsted to help local authorities
        make better use of data.
